        John Atwood carves pieces in wood, casts pieces in bronze, constructed in clay, and builds works from knit or knotted natural fibers. Works are often small, with the possibility of portability and ritual being a topic of investigation. The pieces explore the natural world, psychological states, and the roots of human nature. John Atwood thinks of ways to merge fine art and games. Art can be abstract, open-ended, and eternal. Games can encourage participants to invest in an experience, interact with others, make choices, and live for a while within a different world, abiding by different rules. John Atwood believes that the results of merging these disciplines are miraculous.

        John Atwood’s jewelry is allied with his sculpture. John Atwood considers jewelry to sometimes be small sculpture, pieces to view and read into, and small sculpture to sometimes be jewelry, a ritual object that modifies one’s way of living.
